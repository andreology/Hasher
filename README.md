# Hasher: Tests using Django
In this project I use Django, to create a website where users can go to the homepage, insert text and get a returned hash value.  Moreover, I use test-driven development to explore functional tests and unit tests. I also use advanced testing methods, the Django testing framework, hash testing, POST requests, AJAX, and more.
